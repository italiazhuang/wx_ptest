        <b>WebSurvey Introduction</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to read my article on 4GuysFromRolla.Com.  The survey you are
        viewing was created for demo purposes.  Hopefully, it will give you an idea of how flexible
        the WebSurvey control is.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see, this page contains no questions, it serves as nothing more than an Intro
        or "filler" page.  You can place anything you want in this section, including HTML (as long
        as it is well-formed with regards to XML.
      </p>

      <p>Ok, enough intro.  To get started with the survey, simply click the Next button.</p>
